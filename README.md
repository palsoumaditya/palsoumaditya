I am a Computer Science Engineer currently operating as a Full Stack Developer. My core expertise lies in bridging the gap between complex backend logic and high-performance user interfaces. Unlike a typical junior developer, I approach software engineering with a focus on **systems design, scalability, and production reliability**.

I treat performance as a core feature, not an afterthought. Whether it is designing schema architectures in PostgreSQL or deploying containerized microservices, I strive to build software that is both maintainable and impactful.

## 💼 Current Availability

**🟢 Seeking Full-Time Opportunities**
I am actively looking for new job roles (Frontend, Backend, or Full Stack Engineer). I bring a senior-level engineering mindset to the team, focusing on business logic just as much as the source code.

**🟢 Open for Freelancing & Contract Work**
I am available for freelance projects that require robust full-stack architecture. If you have a complex idea that needs to be translated into a deployable, scalable product, I can manage the complete lifecycle—from database design to frontend deployment.

## 🚀 Why Hire Me?

My value proposition goes beyond writing code. Based on my engineering philosophy and track record, here is what I bring to your team:

### 1. Production-Grade Reliability
I do not just build features; I architect digital products for stability. My experience includes enforcing clean code standards through rigorous peer reviews and executing performance tuning to improve load times.

### 2. Full Lifecycle Ownership
I have expertise spanning the complete lifecycle of an application. I am comfortable designing complex schema architectures in PostgreSQL, building High-Performance UIs in React, and managing DevOps tasks like optimizing CI/CD pipelines.

### 3. Business-Centric Engineering
I believe that code must serve the business. As I state in my portfolio: *"If you are looking for a developer who understands the business logic as clearly as the source code, let's connect."* I focus on building systems that solve actual problems, such as reducing user wait times or automating complex media workflows.

## 🧪 Featured Projects

### **VideoSure**
*Human-in-the-loop Media Platform*
**The Problem:** Automated video editing often lacks precision.
**The Solution:** I built a platform that translates natural language into deterministic FFmpeg transformations. This "human-in-the-loop" system ensures that video processing is both automated and accurate, effectively bridging the gap between AI intent and rigid file outputs.

### **Involve**
*Hyper-Local Services Platform*
**The Problem:** Connecting users with local professionals is often slow and fragmented.
**The Solution:** I developed a revolutionary on-demand platform designed to connect users with pros in under 10 minutes. The architecture focused on low-latency matching and a user-centric experience to drive immediate real-world connections.

### **Edu-Empower**
*Global Scholarship Bridge*
**The Problem:** Students struggle to find and access global educational funding.
**The Solution:** A comprehensive bridge platform connecting students with funding resources. I implemented complex backend logic to aggregate data and secure frontend interfaces to ensure students could safely access financial opportunities.
